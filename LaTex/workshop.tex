% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:

% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex). ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
The Android bug tracking system has a subscribing mechanism whose purpose is to let the developers learn about the importance of a particular bug for the users of the operating system. This mechanism scores a star to a bug each time a user subscribes to that particular bug. In this MSR challenge report we try to find how that mechanism influences the way the developers prioritize the resolution of a bug, either by directly giving the bug a higher priority or by resolving the bug faster. We study the time to close bugs reported in Android, as well as the priority of the bugs, trying to relate each of those variables with the number of subscribers of the bugs. The results show that most of the bugs have the same priority, and that the resolution time has no dependency on the number of stars. Therefore we conclude that there is no relation neither between the number of stars of a bug and the time it requires to be solved, nor between the number of stars of a bug and the priority the developers assign to the bug.

\section{Introduction}
%%\url {http://2012.msrconf.org/challenge.php}.
Bug reporting is an essential component of the development model of an open source project. Testing and validation of the project is mainly performed by users, who can contribute back to the project by reporting bugs. The more users inspecting and testing the code of a project, the quickest any bug will be located and the more probable is that someone finds a fix for the bug (Linus' Law \cite{CathedralBazaar}). Therefore, bug tracking systems (BTSs) are essential for the management and growth of open source projects, allowing direct and organized communication between users and developers of the project.

The bug tracker plays a crucial role on the development of the project as it centralizes all the developments requests. But from the point of view of project planning, the tracker presents a big challenge because of the large amount of information gathered. Prioritizing all that information is fundamental for the definition of the road map of the project. The developers need to classify the bugs according to some criteria in order to generate a prioritized list of pending tasks, given that it is impossible to solve all the bugs as they are being reported.

In order to do that classification, the number of users interested in a particular bug should be a good measure of the relevance of the bug and by extension a measure of the importance of the bug for the developers of any project. To help cope with this issue, some bug tracking systems incorporate a mechanism which lets users subscribe to bugs, and thus enable a mechanism for prioritizing them. This is the case of Android. Like most of the open source projects do, the Android project maintains a public bug tracker where users can report bugs and request features for the Android software stack, as well as subscribe to bugs. As stated by the Android bug tracker [REF], the number of users subscribed to a bug influences the the way developers prioritizes the bug. We would like to know if the mechanism is actually effective and working as expected.

From the moment a bug is reported, up until it is closed, the bug may be in different states of progress. This current state is tracked through a status assigned to the bug. Bug reporters and members of the community are allowed to subscribe to any particular bug in order to be notified by mail each time the status of the bug is changed.  For each bug, the tracker keeps a metric named stars. A star is scored to a bug each time a user subscribes to the state of the bug. The number of stars of a bug is then equivalent to the number of members of the community that have explicitly shown interest on the state of that particular bug. When reporting a bug or  while browsing the reported issues, the users click on a star-shaped check box in order to subscribe to a bug. Hence the name of the metric. This information is reported in the tracker to be considered by the developers in order to prioritize the resolution of the bugs, so the developers are expected to attend first those bugs with more subscribers, that is, the ones which have more relevance for the community.

We believe that if developers take into account the number of subscribers of a bug for the development of the project, then we should observe some relation between the number of stars of a bug and the time that bug takes to be solved. We should also expect to see a correlation between the priority of a bug and the number of stars of that particular bug. The objective of this paper is to evaluate these two statements using the bug reports provided in XML format by the MSR 2012 challenge [REF].

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: the next section describes the data source used for this project. Section 3 provides the statistical analysis used in this study, while Section 4 presents our results. Section 5 includes a description of the requirements that the data source must fulfill in order to use the methodology described in section 3. The last section includes conclusions and some considerations for further work.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection {Data gathering}
%\emph{BTS Data}
We have made the current study from the data provided for the Mining Challenge of the 9th International Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR) [4]. Specifically, we have extracted the needed information from the bugs reported on the tracker of the project, provided in XML format.

We developed a Java application to parse the XML document containing the bug information by means of the StAX (Streaming API for XML) API. Traditionally XML APIs are either DOM based, which support random access but are very resource consuming, or event based, which are very efficient but are not very user-friendly. The StAX API is designed to close the gap between those two approaches. It is able to cope with big XML documents (the provided document takes up approximately 2GB of space) without consuming too much resources, and at the same time presents an easy to use interface.

We only included closed bugs. For each bug we evaluated the required time to be solved, computing it from the bug opening and closing timestamps provided in the bug document. We converted their timestamps into UTC seconds. Subtracting the values corresponding to the closing and opening timestamps we got the number of seconds invested to solve the bug. This resolution is the minimum we considered appropriate, since the bug that required less time took 17 seconds to be solved. The resulting application parses the bugs and exports the number of stars of that bug, its priority and the number of seconds that the bug required to be fixed to a text file. This file allowed us to import the data into a GNU R environment in order to process it. R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques [8], so it fulfilled our statistical and graphic needs for the present study. Once we had the data we needed imported into GNU R, we applied the methodology presented of the next section.

\subsection {Statistical Analysis}
We are trying to validate two hypotheses, (1) the time required to solve a particular bug has some statistical dependence with the number of subscribers of the bug, and (2) the priority assigned by the developers to a particular bug has some statistical dependence with the number of subscribers of the bug.
\\
Dependence of the time to fix a bug on the number of subscribers
\\
In order to validate the first of our hypothesis, first of all we represent the boxplot of the times to close  bugs and the number of subscribers, in order to have a quick evaluation of the ranges of the variables. Then we group the bugs by number of subscribers in order to study the relation between number of subscribers and resolution time. We discard the possibility of evaluating the mean length of time required to close bugs with a particular number of subscribers. Not all the values for every number of subscribers have the same number of bugs, so the average values might be biased. Therefore we studied the resolution times for all the bugs instead of studying only the mean values for the bugs that share the same number of subscribers.
Our study is based on the iteration over possible statistical relations in order to find the influence of the number of subscribers on the resolution time of the bugs. First we plot the resolution time of each bug against the number of subscribers of the bug. We face with overplotting because of the huge amount of bugs towards the lower numbers of subscribers. We repeat the plot adding jitter noise to the samples and using transparency on the points. Given the large range of values on both axes, we switch to logarithmic scale in order to reduce the range sizes.

Then, in order to infer a possible statistical distribution, we plot the density function of the logarithm of the number of subscribers of the bugs. 

Then we plot the cumulative distribution function of the resolution time. In particular, we use the inverse of the cumulative distribution function, because cognitive psychology tells us that it is easier to discern variations on descent curves [7].

We also try to approximate the distribution of the samples with a Poisson distribution. We repeat the process with an exponential distribution.

Finally we compute the value of the correlation between the resolution time and the number of subscribers of the bugs. First we compute the Pearson coefficient, which measures linear correlation. Then we compute both Kendall and Spearman coefficients, which measures if there is any kind of strong relation between both variables, even if it is not linear.
\\
Dependence of the priority of a bug on the number of subscribers
\\
We have also tried to relate a bug priority with its number of subscribers. In a analogous way as with do with the bug resolution time, we represented the bug priority against  the number of subscribers.
